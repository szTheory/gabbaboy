# Project State

## Project Reference

See: [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) (updated 2026-10-24)

**Core value:** Run Game Boy software faithfully through a deterministic, understandable core that frontends can embed without surprises.
**Current focus:** Phase 17 — Native Save State Core

## Current Position

Phase: 17 (Native Save State Core) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 11
Status: Executing Phase 17
Last activity: 2026-10-26 — Wave 3 verified locally at `1df0b1e`; full suite 1299/1299. Fix hosted integration before 17-04.

Prior phase evidence: **Phase 16 execution** — plans 16-01..16-07 merged; [16-VERIFICATION.md](phases/GB-16-tune-up-and-v0-2-debt-closure/16-VERIFICATION.md) `passed` 5/5 (TUNE-01..06); [16-VALIDATION.md](phases/GB-16-tune-up-and-v0-2-debt-closure/16-VALIDATION.md) Nyquist-compliant; code review 0 critical / 5 warning / 4 info, all deferred to Phase 17 as RM-030 ([16-REVIEW-DISPOSITION.md](phases/GB-16-tune-up-and-v0-2-debt-closure/16-REVIEW-DISPOSITION.md)). Boundary commit `boundary_sha: 92364c78ac002b8e199ca7e6cad4130701fe98ba`; `verify-v03-dispositions.py --check ... --rev 92364c7` passes (rows=26 pending=0 closed=6). Deviations (owner-waived gap rounds #116/#118/#120, post-tag fixes #123/#124/#125, four review issues with #122 approved) are in D-112.

Prior phase evidence: **Phase 16 verification** — [16-UAT.md](phases/GB-16-tune-up-and-v0-2-debt-closure/16-UAT.md) closes 51/51 deliverables automatically (zero human checkpoints, `verify-uat-closure.py` 21 controls); full suite 1234/1234 at `be4cee8`; goal verification re-run at the final head `passed` 5/5 (the prior report was stale only because `boundary_sha` was appended to 16-07-SUMMARY.md, LESSONS GB-GSD-027); [16-SECURITY.md](phases/GB-16-tune-up-and-v0-2-debt-closure/16-SECURITY.md) `threats_open: 0` (32 threats; T-16-22/T-16-25 owner-accepted under D-112 as AR-16-01/02, gate code added to RM-030).

Completed stage: **Phase 17 execution, waves 1–3 of 11**. Plans 17-01/02/03 provide the codec/API, strong identity, canonical validation, field census, exact observer/RTC/palette restoration, whole-instance refusal and allocation/hash purity controls. Full local post-wave suite at `1df0b1e`: 1299/1299 pass. Draft PR #130 tests earlier `032ea01`; hosted CI fails C++ `<cstdint>` portability, Mach-O-only/ELF-relocation/ASan global classification, and standalone perf release defines. Correct those integration issues before **wave 4 / plan 17-04**, then rerun current hosted checks. Resume command: `/gsd-execute-phase 17`. Eight plans and phase qualification remain. The next feature phase is **18 — Player Save Slots and Host Contract**, after Phase 17 execution/verification and owner choice.
Both `workflow.auto_advance` and `workflow._auto_chain_active` remain false; stop at the Phase 17 boundary.

Runtime configuration (2026-10-26): owner switched future OpenGSD work to Codex, retaining the `adaptive` profile. Heavy/opus uses `gpt-6.1-sol` at `high` effort; standard/sonnet and light/haiku use `gpt-6-luna` at `xhigh` effort. Project `.planning/config.json` is authoritative; resolve each role's model and effort before dispatch. This configuration change does not start Phase 17.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Historical decisions, including the per-plan records of Phases 1-16, moved to [v0.2-STATE-ARCHIVE.md](milestones/v0.2-STATE-ARCHIVE.md). Adopted choices live in [DECISIONS.md](context/DECISIONS.md); new decisions are appended below by the runtime.

### Pending Todos

None outside the roadmap.

### Blockers/Concerns

Historical blockers and concerns (v0.1 and v0.2 audits, triage and phase notes) moved to [v0.2-STATE-ARCHIVE.md](milestones/v0.2-STATE-ARCHIVE.md). Phase 17 plans fit STATE-01..06 and RM-026/028/029/030 within 11 primary plans plus one reserved gap slot. Header layout and temporary all-path horizon feasibility are researched; permanent all-wrapper closure, body-size and inductive audio bounds remain ordered execution gates. Unproved correctness/security invariants require rescope. RM-027 is a named Phase 19 entry blocker, not a closed item.

### Quick Tasks Completed

| # | Description | Date | Commit | Directory |
|---|-------------|------|--------|-----------|

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 06.1 inserted after Phase 6: Address v0.1 tech debt: CI workflow info items and audio consumer coverage (URGENT)
- 2026-10-10: v0.2 roadmap created — Phases 7–15 continue v0.1 numbering. Order follows research/v0.2/SUMMARY.md: acceptance + DMG baseline (7); seam merged with MBC5 and MBC2 (8, MBC5/MBC2 plans parallel after the seam plan); MBC3 + RTC + loader matrix + new-mapper continuation (9); CGB profile/banking (10); colour PPU + player colour (11); double speed (12) and HDMA (13) kept separate and sequential; CGB-E qualification + corpus (14); CGB acceptance, ledger and release (15). Deep phase research flagged for 9, 11, 12, 13, 14. Rights gates: G5/G2 on 7; G1 on 9, 11, 14; G3 on 9; G4 on 11.
- Phase 15.1 inserted after Phase 15: Release Hardening and Milestone Debt Closure; owner chose recommended resolve-first closeout (URGENT)
- 2026-10-24: v0.2 milestone completed and archived (override_closeout). The ROADMAP is collapsed to milestone groupings, and the phase records stay in place because CTest reads them.
- Phase 17 edited: Discussion reconciled existing RM-026/028/029/030 entry obligations into Phase 17 success criteria 6–8 and requirement traceability; scope remains four phases, cap 12 (11 primary plus gap slot). No implementation or auto-advance.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| uat_gaps | GB-14-cgb-e-model-qualification-and-corpus/14-UAT-REVIEW.md | clean (0 pending scenarios; scanner false positive) | 2026-10-24 | v0.2 |

The archived v0.2 requirements are in [v0.2-REQUIREMENTS.md](milestones/v0.2-REQUIREMENTS.md) (28/28 complete). Deferred v0.3 items (STATE-01, INT-01) and later direction are in its Future section and [FUTURE-MILESTONES.md](context/FUTURE-MILESTONES.md).

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-10-26T22:06:10.993Z
**Stopped at:** Phase 17 wave 3 verified locally; fix hosted integration before plan 17-04
**Resume file:** .planning/phases/GB-17-native-save-state-core/continue.md

Completed stage: **Phase 17 execution, waves 1–3 locally verified**. Next stage: **Phase 17 — Native Save State Core, hosted integration correction then wave 4 / plan 17-04**, `/gsd-execute-phase 17`. The next feature phase remains **18 — Player Save Slots and Host Contract**, after Phase 17 execution and verification and an owner-selected handoff. Both automatic advance flags stay false.

## Operator Next Steps

- Execute Phase 17 (Native Save State Core) with `/gsd-execute-phase 17`; reuse `17-CONTEXT.md`, research, patterns and verified plans. RM-027 remains a Phase 19 entry blocker. Do not start Phase 18 automatically.
