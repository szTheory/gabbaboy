# Project State

## Project Reference

See: [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) (updated 2026-10-07)

**Core value:** Run Game Boy software faithfully through a deterministic, understandable core that frontends can embed without surprises.
**Current focus:** Phase GB-06 — Qualified DMG Release and Consumer Handoff

## Current Position

Phase: 6 — Qualified DMG Release and Consumer Handoff
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-08 — Phase 5 complete, transitioned to Phase 6

Progress: ███████░░░ [████████░░] 83% of milestone phases complete. Phases 1–5 passed goal verification. Phase 5 completed all seven plans and passed 22/22 goal truths at source `206e107210e750ff0fe647a19b82600b17e98ee3`. Its final local evidence includes core CTest 174/174, the pinned SDL 3.4.18 player/package verifier 50/50, and a clean-tree 300-frame two-partition receipt with identical 241,094-frame PCM digests. See the linked Phase 5 verification and validation reports. CGB/VIN, physical playback/hotplug, and perceptual output remain unqualified.

Phase 5 closeout: The app-level lifecycle test exercises Space pause/resume and R reset through SDL events, checking APU continuation, host PCM clearing, save failure/cancel/retry, and persisted battery recovery. Code review is clean and the security report records zero open threats. The dummy backend and injected events establish software-path behavior only; no physical device, hotplug, or perceptual result is claimed. Phase 6 has not started.

## Performance Metrics

- Unique plans: 49; average duration / total execution time: 25 min / 700 min. Phase completion follows goal verification, not task count alone.
- Per-phase metrics / recent trend: Phases 1–5 are verified complete. Phase 3 has 13/13 plan summaries, 5/5 goal truths, 33/33 UAT checks, a user-confirmed packaged Z press/release, and 141/141 local CTest. PR #4's required exact-head checks passed before merge. Phase 5's current local exact-head evidence is in `GB-05-dmg-audio-and-stable-playback/05-VERIFICATION.md` and `05-VALIDATION.md`; confirm exact-head remote PR checks before any merge rather than inferring them from local results. D-025 bounds VIDEO-02/03 to the confidence-qualified software model; no physical CPU-B measurement is claimed. Plan 02-15 is superseded/non-runnable and remains historical.
- Emulator correctness, speed, memory, and CI baselines: No general hardware/gameplay baseline. At implementation SHA `cf28e90270be24d9528bfa8a1e4055a2b8485989`, the local offline inventory passed 104/104 with no skips, the relocated installed C/C++ inventory passed 109/109, the runner passed its fixed one-CPU/two-timer derived corpus, hosted CI run 37620710587 passed, and fixture reproduction run 37620710600 passed. Independent verification passed all five CPU requirements. Original upstream PPU-dependent reporting paths remain excluded; no physical DMG hardware test occurred.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Adopted choices: [DECISIONS.md](context/DECISIONS.md). Evidence navigation: [research/INDEX.md](research/INDEX.md); synthesis dated 2026-10-02.

- Scope is GB/DMG and GBC/CGB. v0.1 is a limited DMG preview; GB/GBC breadth is the next named milestone.
- Original portable C17 core, native opaque-instance API, optional SDL3 macOS adapter; explicit time/ownership and bounded operations.
- ROM-only/scoped MBC1 and battery continuation in v0.1; no stable ABI promise. Future scope remains in [FUTURE-MILESTONES.md](context/FUTURE-MILESTONES.md).
- OpenGSD workflow: automate within the authorized phase, require current evidence, then stop. Both auto-advance settings remain false; session model is inherited.
- [Phase 01]: The tracer starts from an explicit bootless DMG-CPU-B profile; deterministic RAM fill is emulator policy, not hardware startup evidence.
- [Phase 01]: RGBDS v1.0.1 is required only for fixture regeneration; normal build and digest verification use checked-in bytes offline.
- [Phase 01]: ROM validation returns distinct bounded errors and failed replacement loads leave active guest state unchanged.
- [Phase 01]: Reset retains the loaded ROM while restoring deterministic post-boot CPU state and clearing guest RAM and emulated time.
- [Phase 01]: The installed export explicitly maps the core library to GabbaBoy::core.
- [Phase 01]: Installed consumer tests are registered only when the relocated prefix exists, preserving ordinary offline CTest runs.
- [Phase 01]: CI uses explicit runner labels and a fail-closed 26-case installed CTest inventory with a 23-case core subset; runner images are not product OS claims.
- [Phase 01]: The official CMake 3.25.3 floor script and RGBDS 1.0.1 fixture reproduction passed locally in Ubuntu x86_64 containers and on PR #1; run-scoped hosted evidence is recorded in 01-VALIDATION.md.
- [Phase 01]: Pin explicit native runner labels and require every evidence job plus its exact test inventory; do not infer product OS support from runner labels.
- [Phase 01]: Keep hosted CI and branch-protection evidence pending until exact-revision remote results are observed; fixture-repro is a separate status context.
- [Phase GB-01]: Qualify preview packages and contributor claims against an exact PR SHA; query the artifact API for per-run expiry and report it without calling temporary artifacts releases.
- [Phase 01]: The bootless DMG-CPU-B tracer verifies the bounded API and guest path, not hardware-qualified memory mapping; Phase 2 owns that evidence.
- [Phase 01]: At verified implementation SHA `8396096ad17500974b30657af91fd2ef9ad51237`, all five roadmap truths and eight BASE requirements passed, standard code review was clean, and required PR contexts plus both package artifacts passed exact-SHA verification.
- [Phase 01]: Final exact hosted evidence also passed at docs-only PR SHA `9f1df9bd0a70e50033f7d8cbcbff778e3bfd94e3` after the Phase 1 closeout documentation was committed; the implementation is unchanged from SHA `8396096ad17500974b30657af91fd2ef9ad51237`.
- [Phase GB-02]: ROM-only A000-BFFF reads stop as unsupported bus and writes have no effect.
- [Phase GB-02]: The side-effect-free peek API exposes WRAM, its echo, and HRAM only.
- [Phase GB-02]: The original tracer moved its protocol from fixture-policy A000 RAM to WRAM C000/C001.
- [Phase GB-02]: RGBDS 1.0.1 fixture regeneration uses the SHA-verified official macOS archive.
- [Phase GB-02]: Unused SM83 encodings persistently lock with original PC/opcode until reset; CB-prefixed instruction semantics are owned by Plan 02-03.
- [Phase 02]: CB register operations cost 16 half-dots; BIT (HL) costs 24; other (HL) CB operations cost 32.
- [Phase 02]: BIT preserves carry and sets H; RES and SET preserve flags; rotate/shift groups set Z and carry from their results.
- [Phase 02]: Interrupt entry costs 40 half-dots, selects the lowest enabled pending bit, clears it, and pushes the interrupted PC on timed bus phases.
- [Phase 02]: HALT idle advances eligible time in whole 8-half-dot cycles; STOP remains stopped until the timestamped wake path in Plan 02-06.
- [Phase GB-02]: Timer divider falling edges and qualified TIMA/TMA reload collisions run at timed bus phases; serial overlap without qualified ordering returns bounded unsupported.
- [Phase GB-02]: STOP waits advance only the bounded master timeline; oscillator-driven CPU, divider, timer, and internal serial state stays frozen.
- [Phase GB-02]: Timestamped input uses a fixed 64-event queue with atomic admission and stable caller order for equal timestamps.
- [Phase GB-02]: Keep the eligible CPU/timer corpus denominator fixed; guest assertions, callbacks and exact result PCs classify outcomes, while digests alone never qualify applicability.
- [Phase GB-02]: Preserve derived fixture bytes, rights and pinned reproduction procedures; original PPU-dependent behavior and physical hardware remain outside the corpus claim.
- [Phase GB-02]: CPU, timer, interrupts, HALT/STOP and reset semantics are covered by the completed Phase 2 verification and validation artifacts.
- [Phase GB-02]: Installed C/C++ consumers and hosted exact-revision checks cover the Phase 2 public package; see the linked verification artifacts.
- [Phase GB-02]: On 2026-10-07, independent verification passed CPU-01 through CPU-05 and all five roadmap truths at implementation SHA `cf28e90270be24d9528bfa8a1e4055a2b8485989`. Final local, installed-consumer, and exact hosted evidence is recorded in Phase 2 verification and validation; original upstream PPU-dependent results and physical hardware behavior remain outside the claim.
- [Phase GB-03]: Keep the playable original ROM fixture separate from PPU composition, raster timing, DMA/access, and scripted gameplay oracles; fixture byte reproducibility does not establish DMG-CPU-B applicability.
- [Phase GB-03]: The initial background renderer advances dots on the emulated timeline and publishes a completed shade frame at VBlank entry; it is not hardware-qualified raster timing.
- [Phase GB-03]: Plan 03-02 adds fixed per-instance transfer slots and source-qualified mode/STAT/fetch expectations; the slot model does not claim electrical or CPU-B FIFO equivalence.
- [Phase GB-03]: Plan 03-03 adopts the narrower Nintendo-manual `$8000–$DFFF` DMA source range despite a pinned Pan Docs conflict; exact simultaneous PPU/DMA collision behavior remains unqualified.
- [Phase GB-03]: FF00 active-low row polling consumes timestamped button events; JOYP interrupt behavior remains gated by D-08. The optional SDL3 player bounds and transactionally replaces ROMs, keeps mutations on the event loop, and uses pixel-aligned integer scaling. The public frame API checks output extents/overlap before writes, and queue capacity precedes entry validation; relocated consumers test both APIs. RGBDS 1.0.1 fixture reproduction now binds assembly source, exact ROM bytes, and pinned archive digests locally and in hosted CI; this is not gameplay or hardware evidence. SDL3 3.4.18 and host timing remain isolated to the adapter.
- [Phase GB-03]: Player help and downloaded-package metadata now assert the preview's audio and battery-persistence limitations; those checks do not establish emulator feature behavior or hardware qualification.
- [Phase GB-03]: Pinned Mooneye cases support the fresh DMA access window, active FF46 restart, and register readback; a focused owned guest suite covers those cases. The upstream README lists a DMG-CPU-B in its hardware fleet but publishes no per-test/per-unit raw log. This evidence does not cover simultaneous PPU/DMA arbitration or JOYP interrupt timing.
- [Phase GB-03]: D-025 adopts a deterministic, confidence-qualified source-backed software model for documented but revision-sensitive JOYP and DMA/PPU behavior; exact CPU-B phases and revision parity remain unmeasured.
- [Phase GB-03]: The optional SDL3 macOS preview displayed the owned demo; the user confirmed holding Z darkens a tile and release restores it. Audio and battery persistence remain clearly identified as unimplemented.
- [Phase GB-03]: Final verification passed 5/5 truths and UAT 33/33; PR #4 passed required exact-head checks and merged as `2b49dc5`.
- [Phase 04]: Hold a nonblocking exclusive advisory lock for the lifetime of each battery-backed player session; the guarantee covers cooperating GabbaBoy processes.
- [Phase 04]: Drive autosave from the core dirty generation and monotonic host time: two seconds quiet or ten seconds maximum age.
- [Phase 04]: On final save failure, require retry, explicit continue without saving, or cancellation before quit, reset, or replacement.
- [Phase 04]: Keep the original MBC1 battery fixture source, rights, manifest, pinned RGBDS recipe, and checked-in bytes together; ordinary tests verify the digest offline.
- [Phase 04]: Prove guest continuation with separate bounded processes and distinct missing-save, wrong-ROM-envelope, and altered-payload controls; this is software evidence, not physical hardware qualification.
- [Phase GB-05]: Expose audio-aware stepping as gbb_run_audio with caller-owned 48 kHz stereo frames; keep legacy run calls muted.
- [Phase GB-05]: Plan 05-03 adds wave/noise channels and all 16 NR52 status combinations as authored deterministic software-model evidence; active wave-RAM current-byte aliasing is an unqualified revision-scoped assumption. AUDIO-01 is complete for the documented digital model; analog, physical hardware, and perceptual output are not qualified.
- [Phase GB-05]: Active wave-RAM accesses alias the current byte in the scoped deterministic model; CPU-B revision variation is unqualified.
- [Phase GB-05]: Use an original per-instance Q15 8-tap FIR and the D-02 48 kHz high-pass approximation; preserve DSP history across output calls and reset it on APU reset.
- [Phase GB-05]: Reject overflowing PCM frame extents and overlap with the returned count before guest work; initialize a valid count output to zero.
- [Phase GB-05]: SDL callback services exact requested bytes and retains partial stereo frames across callbacks to avoid queue overrun.
- [Phase GB-05]: Unavailable audio sinks discard and count PCM immediately while preserving host-paced guest execution.
- [Phase GB-05]: Player gain is host-only, defaults to 100%, and is adjusted with bracket keys.
- [Phase GB-05]: Keep per-controller input keyed by stable SDL joystick IDs in a fixed bounded source table, and admit aggregate button changes to the guest queue before committing source state.
- [Phase GB-05]: Quiesce callbacks before counting and clearing ring, partial-frame, and SDL-stream PCM; perform reset and replacement host cleanup only after existing save transitions succeed.
- [Phase GB-05]: Treat SDL dummy audio and injected device events as software-path evidence; physical hotplug and audible quality remain unqualified.
- [Phase GB-05]: Bind the sustained result to the committed source revision, Release build, scoped DMG model, original licensed fixture, and PCM digest.
- [Phase GB-05]: Keep SDL queued-input bytes and application PCM underflow explicitly separate from playback latency and hardware starvation.
- [Phase GB-05]: Report dummy backend and default-device availability as software/device-presence evidence only; do not claim physical hotplug or perceptual qualification.

### Pending Todos

None outside the roadmap.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 has no open verification or security blocker. All five requirements are complete at implementation SHA `cf28e90270be24d9528bfa8a1e4055a2b8485989`; see [verification](phases/GB-02-dmg-cpu-bus-and-time/02-VERIFICATION.md), [validation](phases/GB-02-dmg-cpu-bus-and-time/02-VALIDATION.md), and [security](phases/GB-02-dmg-cpu-bus-and-time/02-SECURITY.md).
- The admitted corpus is three derived headless reporting closures (one CPU, two timer). Original Mooneye reporting paths depend on PPU/LY behavior outside scope and remain excluded. No physical DMG-CPU-B observation occurred; no hardware qualification is claimed.
- Phase 1 PR #1 and Phase 2 PR #2 were merged on 2026-10-07 after their required exact-head checks passed. Current GitHub triage found no open PRs or issues. Phase 2 verification is limited to its documented DMG-CPU-B CPU/timer scope; no physical DMG observation or PPU qualification is claimed.
- Phase 3 is complete with 5/5 verified truths, 33/33 UAT passes, 141/141 local CTest, clean code review, and required exact-head PR #4 checks. One medium threat, T-03-27, remains below the configured high-severity block threshold; revisit its automated preview-limitation assertion during release work. Exact CPU-B timing/lane and universal PPU-revision parity remain unmeasured; these are explicit evidence limits, not Phase 3 blockers under D-025.
- Native host support floors beyond the verified CI matrix, signing, and live Playstead integration remain later release/adoption work.
